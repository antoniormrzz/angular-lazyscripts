# angular-lazyscripts [![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.io/antoniormrzz/angular-lazyscripts.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.io/antoniormrzz/angular-lazyscripts)

lazy load external js scripts and libraries in your angular projects.
this module will handle loading the script you need before you use it in your components.

## Install

```
npm i -S angular-lazyscripts
```
## Usage

### 1. Import the `AngularLazyscriptsModule`

Import `AngularLazyscriptsModule` from the `angular-lazyscripts` package, and add it to the `NgModule` imports array of your lazy loaded module or the module you need.

```typescript

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
...
import { AngularLazyscriptsModule } from 'angular-lazyscripts';

@NgModule({
  ...,
  imports: [
    ...,
    AngularLazyscriptsModule,
    ...
  ]
  ...
})
export class MyLazyModule {}
```
### 2. Use the `alsLoad` structural directive

Add the `alsLoad` directive with library url (any url you would use in a script tag on your index.html is fine) to your component tag, or one of its parent tags:

```html

    <myComponent *alsLoad="'https://cdn.something.net/somelibrary.js'">
      <!-- this component uses alsLoad directive to load after the script has been loaded -->
  </myComponent>

  <myComponent>
      <!-- this component is loaded immediately without waiting for the library to load  -->
      <!-- this will log an error -->
    </myComponent>

```
please note that the first myComponent component will wait for library to load and will run after the second one, the error you see first is actually logged by the second component.

**note: it adds the library to the bottom of your index.html, you can use the directive as much as you want, each url will be added once**


### 3. Use your script in your component

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, Renderer2, Inject } from '@angular/core';
import { DOCUMENT } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'myComponent',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private renderer2:Renderer2,@Inject(DOCUMENT) private _document) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    const s = this.renderer2.createElement('script');
   s.type = 'text/javascript';
   s.text = `somelibrary.doSomething()`; //this is where you use your library
   this.renderer2.appendChild(this._document.body, s);
  }

}
```
## What it does

sometimes you have no choice but to use external js libraries in your code. depending on the library they can be very large in size, and bundling them with angular will cause your app to become very heavy. the files you list as scripts for angular will be present even on your login page. why would you want to load a heavy pdf library when the user is trying to log in? 

you can use angular-lazyscripts to add your script to the DOM right before you use it in your component.this will improve loading time of your app.

## Info

this library was tested with `angular-cli 7.3.8` and `node 10`, I didn't use observables to avoid rxjs import problems. I think you should be fine in 6+ versions of angular, but if something starts acting up and you get errors, feel free to email me.
if you actually test it on lower versions and it works, please do inform me.

**there is a 15 seconds timeout after which the component will not be added to the page. there won't be any errors. you are responsible with the file you choose.**

## Example project

I have included an archive of my test project. the codes are commented. normally you should be fine with the documentation on this page.
